1.1 Background and Necessity for the Web Application
  College and university students routinely receive money from multiple, irregular
  sources such as monthly allowance from family, part-time or gig-work income,
  scholarships, and occasional gifts, yet rarely track where that money actually
  goes. Generic personal-finance apps are built for salaried adults with fixed pay
  cycles and bank integrations, and they are often too complex, subscription-
  gated, or simply irrelevant to a student's spending patterns (canteen food, hostel
  expenses, textbooks, transport, subscriptions, and social outings).

  There is a clear demand for a lightweight, student-first Web application that
  makes it effortless to log income and expenses, view spending by category, and
  receive plain-language guidance on how to save more without requiring a linked
  bank account or financial expertise. An application is required to fulfil this
  demand by offering a dynamic, responsive platform which provides following
  features:
     • Fast entry of income and expenses with student-relevant categories
     • Personalized, easy-to-follow saving tips generated from the student's own
        transaction history
     • Optional AI assistance that automatically categorizes expenses and
        summarizes monthly spending in plain language

  Built with modern front-end technologies backed by a robust database layer, the
  Web application should ensure a smooth, reliable experience across devices,
  making it ideal for individual students, hostel communities, and campus financial-
  literacy initiatives.

1.2 Proposed Solution
  To close the gap between generic
  finance apps and the realities of
  student     life, this document
  proposes the development of a
  fully functional Web application
  named        Campus    Coin,   a
  responsive, interactive student

                                   © Aptech Limited
budget and expense tracker designed for college and university students.

The application offers a seamless experience where a student can register, log in,
and immediately record income such as allowance, part-time job earnings,
scholarships, and gifts, and expenses such as food, transport, hostel or rent,
academics, subscriptions, entertainment, and miscellaneous. Every transaction is
stored in a central database, which powers category-wise breakdowns, month-
over-month trend charts, and a personalized tips engine that reacts to the
student's own habits. An optional AI-driven assistant can help categorize
expenses automatically as they are entered. It can generate a friendly,
actionable monthly insight summary, for example flagging that food delivery
spending rose sharply, and suggesting a simple and achievable adjustment.

Architecture Overview
The high-level architecture follows a standard three-tier design:

 • Presentation Layer: Responsive Web front end (dashboard, entry forms,
   charts, insights feed)
 • Application/API Layer: Handles authentication, transaction logic, report
   generation, and optional AI-assistant requests
 • Data Layer: Relational database storing users, transactions, categories,
   budgets, and generated insights

1.3 Purpose of the Document
  This document presents a detailed description of the Campus Coin application,
  explaining its features, purpose, scope, and limitations. It is intended for both
  stakeholders and developers of the application and serves as the basis for design,
  development, and evaluation of the project.

1.4 Scope of Project
  Campus Coin is a full-stack Web application designed to help students take
  control of their personal finances by
  logging    income      and    expenses,
  categorizing spending, and reviewing
  their financial habits through monthly
  reports. It offers a personalized
  experience through user registration
  and login, quick transaction entry, a
  category management system, an
  interactive dashboard with charts, and
  a saving-tips engine driven by the
  student's own transaction history.

  The application includes a backend system to support data storage, session
  management, budget-goal tracking, and report generation. Users can add and
  edit transactions, set monthly budgets per category, view spending trends over
  time, receive optional AI-generated categorization suggestions, and read AI-
  generated monthly spending insights with simple, actionable advice. Built with
  modern technologies, the platform is scalable, responsive, and adaptable for
  individual students, student communities, and campus financial-literacy
  programs. Administrative functionality will also be part of the application, giving
  oversight of categories, users, and system-wide usage statistics.

1.5 Constraints
  Development of the Campus Coin Web application must adhere to several
  constraints to ensure successful implementation and operation. Technically, the
  application must be compatible with major Web browsers and responsive across

                                   © Aptech Limited
  desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Constraints may also arise around data
  storage, data synchronization, and backup procedures for transaction history.

  Since Campus Coin does not integrate with real banking systems, all income
  and expense data is manually entered or imported via simple file upload, for
  example CSV. The application will not perform actual bank-account verification,
  real payment processing, or handle real monetary transactions. These aspects
  are beyond the scope of the application. Any AI-generated categorization or
  insight is advisory in nature and must be presented as a suggestion the student
  can review or override, not as certified financial advice.

1.6 Functional Requirements

  The Campus Coin Web application will offer a complete and student-centric
  budgeting experience with dynamic front-end features and robust backend
  support. It will not only cover essential functionality, but also implement advanced
  capabilities to enhance personalization, insight generation, and interactivity.

  User Authentication and Management

Important Note Regarding AI Usage:

You are encouraged to use AI-powered tools (such as AI-assisted Website
builders, UI/UX design tools, code assistants, and image-generation tools) to
enhance productivity and creativity. However, AI should be used as a supporting
aid rather than a substitute for your own design, development, and problem-
solving skills.

Do NOT rely on completely ready-made Website templates for your project, as
this will adversely affect your evaluation. Your Web application’s design, structure,
and implementation should primarily reflect your own skills and understanding. Do
NOT submit AI-generated code or content without meaningful modification and
understanding. AI-generated suggestions may be used for guidance, learning,
debugging, or improving productivity, but the final solution should demonstrate
your own effort, logic, and implementation.

Acknowledge all the AI tool(s) used (for example, Copilot, Canva AI, Figma AI,
Uizard, or similar) in your project documentation or submission.

During evaluation, judges may ask participants to explain their design decisions,
implementation approach, and code. You are, therefore, expected to
understand and be able to justify all aspects of your submitted work.

Do not use AI tools to fully produce ready-made documentation. This is strictly
forbidden.

Bottomline: AI is your assistant, not your developer. Your knowledge,
creativity, and coding skills should drive the project.

1.7 Non-Functional Requirements
  There are several non-functional requirements that should be fulfilled by the
  application. They include:

    • Safe to use: The application should not result in any malicious downloads or
      unnecessary file downloads.
    • Accessibility: The application should have clear and legible fonts, user-
      interface elements, and navigation elements.
    • User-friendliness: The application should be easy to navigate through clear
      menus and easy to understand, especially for first-time users logging their first
      transaction.
    • Operability: The application should be reliable and efficient.
    • Performance: The application should demonstrate high performance
      through speed and throughput, with minimal load time when rendering
      charts and AI-generated insights.
    • Scalability: The application architecture and infrastructure should be
      designed to handle increasing user traffic, growing transaction volume, and
      feature expansions.
    • Security: The application should implement adequate security measures
      such as authentication. Only registered users can access their own
      transaction history.
    • Availability: The application should be available 24/7 with minimum
      downtime.
    • Compatibility: The application should be compatible with the latest browsers
      and various devices.

                              These are the bare minimum expectations from the
                              project. It is a must to implement the FUNCTIONAL and
                              NON-FUNCTIONAL requirements given in this SRS.
                              Once they are complete, you can use your own
                              creativity and imagination to add more features if
                              required.
